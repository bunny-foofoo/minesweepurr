 * that thing where you press both left and right click and stuff happens

# Extra functionality:
 * minefield size settings
 * mine frequency settings

# Creation mode
 * ~~mode toggle button~~
 * ~~the mode itself~~
 * `hide` button

# Solver
 * port python code
 * optimize algorithm (fix method1 too)
 * autosolve button
 * time slider & slowed visuals to see what the solver is doing as it goes
 * decide on a way for it to start (should it really just risk immediate death?)

# Aesthetics:
 * ~~tile hover color~~
 * tile reveal effects
 * game over effects
 * **proper minefield scaling**
 * better tile text (it's ugly and too high)
 * better tile text colors (also fix the bug with them)
 * cute minefield border
 * less unappealing page design
 * fix gross tile hover transition (especially the z-index)
